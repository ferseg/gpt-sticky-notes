# GPT Sticky notes
This is an example application created with Chat GPT

## Achitecture
The application is a client server application.

The server application was created using NestJS, and it exposes a CRUD to play around with sticky notes

The client application is a plain HTML file that contains eveything in it from styling to script

## Reason
This was created just for fun to show how we can use ChatGPT while coding.
